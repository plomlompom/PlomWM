PlomWM version 0.1 / 2011-11-28

PlomWM is an extremely primitive X window manager and @plomlompom's 
personal hack of Nick Welch's TinyWM, done as a C and Xlib learning exercise. 
(@plomlompom = Christian Heller / <c.heller@plomlompom.de>.)

FILES
-----

* Makefile: build system
* plomwm.c: the code
* COPYING: license (public domain)
* README: this file

INSTALLATION
------------

After compilation (type in "make"), put "plomwm" into some path where
it is executable and write something like this into your .xinitrc:

#!/bin/sh
plomwm &
exec xterm

USAGE
-----

* Focus follows pointer.
* Button1 alone: raise window
* Alt+Button1, drag: interactive window move
* Alt+Button3, drag: interactive window resize
* Alt+F1: switch window from/to fullscreen

TO DO
-----

* Alt+Tab should switch between windows; backwards if Shift is added.
* Maybe create some sort of visual window list.
* Make Alt+F1 open a help screen, move fullscreen to Alt+F2.
* Make Alt+F3 open a window-specific menu (for closing window etc.)
