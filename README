PlomWM version 0.4.2 / 2011-12-25

PlomWM is an extremely primitive X window manager and @plomlompom's 
personal hack of Nick Welch's TinyWM, done as a C and Xlib learning exercise. 
(@plomlompom = Christian Heller / <c.heller@plomlompom.de>.)

FILES
-----

* Makefile: build system
* plomwm.c: the code
* COPYING: license (public domain)
* README: this file

INSTALLATION
------------

After compilation (type in "make"), put "plomwm" into some path where
it is executable and write something like this into your .xinitrc:

#!/bin/sh
plomwm &
exec xterm

USAGE
-----

(On PC keyboards, "Mod4" should be the Windows key.)

* Focus follows pointer.
* Mod4+Button1 or Mod4+Button3: raise window below pointer.
* Mod4+Button1, drag: interactive window move.
* Mod4+Button3, drag: interactive window resize.
* Mod4+F11: switch (and raise) window below pointer from/to fullscreen.
* Mod4+Tab: circulate through window stacking order.
* Mod4+Tab+Shift: circulate through window stacking order backwards.

TO DO
-----

* There are some hard-to-reproduce crashes that should be fixed.
* Maybe create some sort of visual window list.
* Make Mod4+F1 open a help screen.
* Make Mod4+F3 open a window-specific menu (for closing window etc.)

CHANGELOG
---------

* 2011-12-25 v. 0.4.2
  * Simplified focus stealing prevention. Don't check for FocusChangeEvents any more.
  * Instead, check EnterNotify for real (forgot previously to do it thoroughly).
* 2011-12-25 v. 0.4.1
  * Improved focus stealing prevention. Checks for and corrects illegal FocusOut events now.
* 2011-12-23 v. 0.4
  * Forced "focus follows pointer" in the code (as opposed to relying on X11 default) as focus stealing prevention. 
* 2011-12-10 v. 0.3
  * Window manipulation is now initiated with Mod4 (Windows key) instead of Mod1 (Alt).
  * Data for switching between fullscreen and normal window size is now collected in the X window properties.
  * Any window manipluation now raises the window affected.
  * Major parts of code rewritten and re-formatted.
  * The changes above resolve some problems with grabbing of user input and keeping track of windows.
* 2011-12-02 v. 0.2.2
  * Moved Fullscreen from ALT+F1 to ALT+F11.
* 2011-12-02 v. 0.2.1
  * Alt+Tab*Shift circulates through window stacking order backwards.
* 2011-12-01 v. 0.2:
  * Alt+Tab now circulates through the window stacking order
* 2011-12-01 v. 0.1.1:
  * Reduce windows[] as windows get destroyed.
* 2011-11-28 v. 0.1
