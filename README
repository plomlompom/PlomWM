PlomWM version 0.2.2 / 2011-12-01

PlomWM is an extremely primitive X window manager and @plomlompom's 
personal hack of Nick Welch's TinyWM, done as a C and Xlib learning exercise. 
(@plomlompom = Christian Heller / <c.heller@plomlompom.de>.)

FILES
-----

* Makefile: build system
* plomwm.c: the code
* COPYING: license (public domain)
* README: this file

INSTALLATION
------------

After compilation (type in "make"), put "plomwm" into some path where
it is executable and write something like this into your .xinitrc:

#!/bin/sh
plomwm &
exec xterm

USAGE
-----

* Focus follows pointer.
* Button1 alone: raise window
* Alt+Button1, drag: interactive window move
* Alt+Button3, drag: interactive window resize
* Alt+F11: switch window from/to fullscreen
* Alt+Tab: circulate through window stacking order
* Alt+Tab+Shift: circulate through window stacking order backwards

TO DO
-----

* There seems to be some unholy confusion between what PlomWM grabs
  as user input and what is available to programs in subwindows.
* Maybe create some sort of visual window list.
* Make Alt+F1 open a help screen.
* Make Alt+F3 open a window-specific menu (for closing window etc.)

CHANGELOG
---------

* 2011-12-02 v. 0.2.11
  * Moved Fullscreen from ALT+F1 to ALT+F11.
* 2011-12-02 v. 0.2.1
  * Alt+Tab*Shift circulates through window stacking order backwards.
* 2011-12-01 v. 0.2:

* 2011-12-01 v. 0.1.1:
